# python-scripts
This repository contains a sample of my python scripts.

The FEWS NET folder contains scripts I wrote while work as a livelihood data analyst for the [Famine Early Warning Systems Network](https://fews.net/).

The BlueBonnet folder contains scripts I wrote while volunteering as [BlueBonnet](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/) fellow. In this role I worked with a team providing volunteer data support to the campaign to reelect Kelly Fowler to the Virginia State House of Representatives.
